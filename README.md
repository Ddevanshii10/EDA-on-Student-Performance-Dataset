EDA on student perfromance dataset

"EDA with Student Performance" primarily focuses on analyzing student performance data. Here's a description of the project:

Objective: The project aims to explore and analyze the relationship between various factors (like gender, test preparation course completion, and scores in different subjects) and the overall student performance.

Data Analysis:

The data is visualized using histograms and scatter plots to uncover patterns and insights.
Key variables include gender, scores in subjects (math, reading, writing), and whether students completed a test preparation course.
The analysis specifically highlights the impact (or lack thereof) of the test preparation course on student performance.
Key Insights:

In general, the test preparation course does not significantly affect student performance, regardless of gender.
Surprisingly, students who did not complete the test preparation course tend to perform better than those who did.
Visualizations:

Histograms showing the distribution of average scores by gender and course completion.
Multiple scatter plots and density plots are used to visualize relationships between different features.
This analysis focuses on understanding the factors influencing student test outcomes, providing educators with insights into performance patterns. â€‹
